#Support Vector Machine
Implementation of a (linear) Support Vector Machine model in python (on heart.csv.csv dataset). 
The dataset has 8 input parameters (Age, Gender, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholestrol, Fasting Blood Pressure, Maximum Heart Rate, Angina).
By using these parameters the model will predict (output) wheather the patient is healthy or has a heart disease.
